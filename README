DKIM Verification plugin for SquirrelMail
===========================================
Ver 0.1, 2018/09/25


Copyleft  (-) 2018 Andrew Sachen <webmaster@realityripple.com>


Description
===========

This plugin quickly displays the validity of DKIM signed messages
(those that are signed with a "DKIM-Signature" header).

This plugin requires OpenSSL to be installed, as it does not use the
OpenSSL extensions of PHP (that is a *feature*, since the PHP extensions
have been known to be buggy).

Note that this plugin does NOT *generate* DKIM signed emails.


Donations
=========

If you or your company make regular use of this software,
please consider supporting Open Source development by

License
=======

This plugin is unlicensed and can be considered in the public domain
(see LICENSE for details).


Requirements
============

  * OpenSSL (ALWAYS have the newest version installed!)

  * SquirrelMail version 1.1.1 or above

  * If not using SquirrelMail 1.4.10+ or 1.5.2+,
    Compatibility plugin version 2.0.7 or above


Troubleshooting
===============

  * Make sure the plugin is configured correctly by browsing to
    http://your-squirrelmail-location/src/configtest.php

  * If you experience problems related to the programs needed by
    this plugin (echo and openssl), typing "which echo" and
    "which openssl" on a command line can help.  This plugin
    assumes you have these programs installed and available and
    should only be installed once you have those tools.

  * If changes to the configuration file don't seem to be having any
    effect, ensure that you are editing the correct configuration
    file.  If one is located in the main SquirrelMail config directory
    (named "config_dkim.php"), it will always be used.  Otherwise,
    "config.php" in the dkim plugin directory will be used.
